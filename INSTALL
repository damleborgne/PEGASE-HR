===============================================================================
PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS

This distribution can be installed on virtually any Unix/Linux platform.
The following tools are needed:
   - A Fortran compiler (f77)
     (if no such compiler is available we advice to use the GNU (free) g77)

   - cfitsio library
     cfitsio is a high quality (free) library available from:
     http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html
     It has become the standard library to access FITS files, it is easy
     to install.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

     The installation procedure is fully described in the file
     README.ps (located in the doc/ directory). The main steps are:

  1) Configuration

     Run:
     > autoconf
     > cd src ; moduledep.sh > .dependencies; cd ..
     > ./configure
     > make

     The package requires the cfitsio library. If it is not installed
     in a standard location you may indicate the path to this library 
     in the configure option --with libraries, as eg.:

     > ./configure --with-libraries=/mypath_to_cfitsio/lib/

     If cfitsio is not available on the current machine, you have
     to install it before intalling PEGASE-HR

  2) Build the library and executable programs
     Run:
     >  make
     The executables are then located in the bin/ directory.

  3) Test installation
     You can test the installation by running 
     > make test
     This  will take a few minutes on a standard 1-1.5 GHz PC processor)

  4) Use PEGASE-HR
     The programs of PEGASE-HR can be executed from any directory, they
     read input files from the current directory and data files from
     the installation directory, and produce output files
     in current directory also.
     To easily access PEGASE-HR, copy the content of peg_cshrc or peg_bashrc
     into your .cshrc or .bashrc file, depending on what shell you use.

     See the instructions in the file README.ps
