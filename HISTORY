HISTORY for PEGASE-HR

Version 1.0, 22/08/2004: Initial version
Version 1.1, 19/01/2005: Bug fixes
  - D4000 break in colors_HR.f90: 'area' is set to 1.0 when typecalib=0
    Before this fix, D4000 was too low by 13 percents.
  - The default value for the initial metallicity of the gas is
    changed from 0 to 0.02 in scenarios_HR.f, to avoid a problem with
    zero metallicity stars at high spectral resolution.
Version 1.2, 01/08/2008: Bug fixes
  - filenames longer than 80 character are now possible.
  - in fitstodat.f: didn't compile on some systems because of a missing argument (anyf) in call to ftgpve in routine rw_spoectra_flux.
Version 1.3, 15/02/2011: Bug fixes
  - in spectra_HR.f : i912=0 instead of 0 (should not affect most calculations)
Version 1.3.1, 28/6/2017 : Bug fixes
  - fixed logical unit management (mainly in pegase_func.f)
  - set the default compilation flag to -O4 instead of -g -O2
